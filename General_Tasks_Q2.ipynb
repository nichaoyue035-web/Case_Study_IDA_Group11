    "## Task 2: Data Storage in Separate Files\n",
    "\n",
    "In database design and large-scale data analysis, it is usually better to store data in several related tables/files instead of one single flat table. The main advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reduced Redundancy**  \n",
    "   - Information does not need to be repeated across different rows.  \n",
    "   - Saves storage space and avoids inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improved Consistency and Integrity**  \n",
    "   - When some information changes (e.g., manufacturer name), it only needs to be updated once.  \n",
    "   - Easier to enforce integrity constraints (primary keys, foreign keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Better Query and Management Efficiency**  \n",
    "   - For a specific task, only the relevant table needs to be loaded instead of a huge dataset.  \n",
    "   - Databases can optimize queries using indexes more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scalability and Flexibility**  \n",
    "   - New types of data can be added by creating new tables without redesigning the entire structure.  \n",
    "   - Different teams can maintain separate tables more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Security and Access Control (optional)**  \n",
    "   - Access permissions can be granted to different tables, improving data security.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database structure name:**  \n",
    "This table structure represents a **relational database schema**, which follows the principle of **normalization**: splitting data into multiple related tables connected through primary and foreign keys.\n"
